This is a multiplayer pacman.

First, run the serverMain.py to play as pacman.

Then open up clientMain.py to play as a ghost.

The game ends if:

Pacman collects all items

Pacman eats the power pellet (big circle) and touches a ghost

Ghost touches the pacman when pacman is not powered up

Known errors:

Sometimes the pacman/ghost doesn't die if they're swapping places.

Possible improvements:

We wanted to implement a simple AI to move the ghosts, but there were time constraints. :(
